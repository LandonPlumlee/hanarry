# Expectations

Junior Coaches are extremely important and involved in teaching the Storm Chasers,
and for that reason, we have a number of expecations for you because of how much we depend on your 

1. Attendance:

Each of you are expected to be at practice everyday, and we plan on that. If you
are unable to come, your lesson will either be covered by a lead coach, or
your Storm Chasers will be dispersed to other coaches. For this reason, we ask you
to inform us of your absense by the Sunday before. We are always making plans,
those plans involve your presense. If we were planning on your presense and you
aren't there, all of our planning goes out the window. You as a Junior Coach are
very important to the team, and we need to know whenever you will no be there.

You are expected to be there Monday through Thursday teaching your Storm Chasers
during their practice, and also there on Friday to review your progress that week.

2. Presence and Care

When you are at practice coaching, you are expected to be mentally present, engaged,
and act with care for what you are doing. Teaching little kids how to swim is not
easy and isn't something that you can merely show up for.

3. Planning

The best way to improve for the future is to plan. If you have no plan, there is
nothing to improve upon. When you do have a plan, you can think about it over time
and make improvements, but when it is all spur of the moment, you are playing catch up
and reacting to what is happening around you, instead of guiding it. 

Storm Chasers are chaotic and hard to plan specifically for, but coming unprepared for
all the potential scenarios is a sure way to be ineffective.
