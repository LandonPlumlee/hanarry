**Principles:**
1. We are creating future Parkview swimmers.
2. Myelin makes excellence easy, but it takes time.
3. People learn from information, not criticism or compliments.
4. Safety is required.
5. Great progress requires ignition.
6. Skills build on each other.
7. You are always coaching individuals.
8. Every day makes a difference.
9. Example is the greatest teacher.
11. Testing helps the teacher teach and the learner learn.

## Safety is required.
Before we may teach anything to our young swimmers we must ensure their safety. In a very extreme circumstance, during the summer of 2022, 4yo boy Israel "Izzy" Scott drowned during a private (one-on-one) swim lesson at private home in Georgia prompting the Georgia General Assembly to pass "Izzy"'s Law in May of 2023. The instructor was charged with criminal negligence and has since been arrested.

Now, this story is not here to scare you but to make it clear that even in a situation where there should be no concern about safety, terrible things can still happen. In our program, Storm Chasers are taught with--at most--three inexperienced swimmers in the water for every one instructor with supervision of Lead Coaches and parents, and private lessons are always one-to-one only under the supervision of the parent. These circumstances require great care and responsibility.

### Requirements of Izzy's Law:
1. **Instructor-to-Student Ratio:** Less than 1:4 for beginner swimmers. Ours is 1:3 for Storm Chasers and 1:1 for private lessons.
2. **Secondary Supervision:** There must be a second person who is not participating in the lesson, but is present and watching. For Storm Chasers, the Lead Coaches are the secondary supervision while parents are extra. For private lessons, the lifeguard is the secondary supervision **while on duty**, and while off duty **it is the parent**.
3. **Parental Involvement:** Parents must be allowed to watch. Parents are permitted to watch Storm Chasers from a distance (enough to put the swimmer's attention on the coach), and they are required to watch during private lessons.
4. **CPR Certification:** Either the instructor or secondary supervision must have a certification in **C**ardio**p**ulmonary **R**esuscitation (CPR). All instructors will be certified in CPR at the beginning of the season.

### A Higher Standard of Safety
Risk of drowning on our team should be very low, because there is no way to offer a superior level of instruction without sufficient supervision to more than prevent drowning. The largest safety risk, which we will not permit, is letting swimmers out of your sight for any period of time.

One of the challenges of instructing Storm Chasers is that there are three of them and they don't have strong motivation. This makes it very tempting to simply split your time between the three of them and in essence offer three ten-minute lessons rather than a 30-minute lesson for all of them. Individual work is necessary at times to teach, however you should use methods that allow all three to learn and swim at once rather than giving periods of work to each person. *The safety risk of this is that when you work with one swimmers for an extended period of time, you leave the other two out of your vision.* You must **never** do this. If you have to leave the other two out of your vision, they must be out of the water, and you must still watch to make ensure they remain out of the water.

Beyond this even, your work throughout the lesson is to build the swimmer's comfort in the water: a.k.a. mental safety. Comfort, or mental perception of safety, enables all of your swimmers to try new thingg, engage, and listen to you. Rather than splitting their attention between you and their fear of the water, they can focus on learning and listening to you. This is a valuable first step for all swimmers to maximize your subsequent lessons.
