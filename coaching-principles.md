## 1 Safety First
Before we may teach anything to our young swimmers we must ensure their safety. In a very extreme circumstance, during the summer of 2022, 4yo boy Israel "Izzy" Scott drowned during a private (one-on-one) swim lesson at private home in Georgia prompting the Georgia General Assembly to pass "Izzy"'s Law in May of 2023. The instructor was charged with criminal negligence and has since been arrested.

Now, this story should not scare you, but it should make it clear that even in a situation where there should be no concern about safety, terrible things can still happen. In our program, Storm Chasers are taught with at most three inexperienced swimmers in the water for every one instructor with supervision of Lead Coaches and parents, and private lessons are always one-to-one only under the supervision of the parent. These circumstances require great care and responsibility.

### Requirements of Izzy's Law:
1. **Instructor-to-Student Ratio:** Less than 1:4 for beginner swimmers. Ours is 1:3 at most for Storm Chasers and 1:1 for private lessons.
2. **Secondary Supervision:** There must be a second person who is not participating in the lesson, but is present and watching. For Storm Chasers, the Lead Coaches are the designated supervision while parents are extra. For private lessons, the lifeguard is the designated supervision **while on duty**, and while off duty *it is the parent*.
3. **Parental Involvement:** Parents must be allowed to watch. We allow parents to watch Storm Chasers and private lessons. We require them to watch private lessons.
4. **CPR Certification:** Either the instructor or secondary supervisor must have a certification in **C**ardio**p**ulmonary **R**esuscitation (CPR). All instructors will be certified in CPR at the beginning of the season.

### A Higher Standard of Safety
We are not purely concerned with meeting the laws of the land. We have standards of our own.
