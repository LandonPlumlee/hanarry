# Notes on *The Talent Code*

### Introduction
There is a very special place that people go where they learn at an incredibly accelerated pace. It is the code to excellent practice and growing talent quickly. Figuring out how to practice in this way is the question for everyone everywhere.

Extreme learning happens at the convergence of deep practice, ignition, and coaching.

## Part I: Deep Practice

### 1: The Sweet Spot
The magic of exceptional practice. Focus on the mistakes and stretch yourself to the places where you get it wrong, and then slow it down, get it right, snap it into place, and then move on with excellence.

It is the use of deep practice and the slightly increased mental difficulty of things that produces great results.

It is the act of stumbling every so briefly that makes you brain focus, give more attention, and get it right. The most empowering presention may not be the best teacher. The best teacher is one who gets the students attention, and challenges them with the content. Easy explanations are not helpful. Slightly difficult explanations are what are helpful. This could be the source of optimal difficulty.

Creating solutions from yourself after a struggle to get there is deep practice that creates better knowledge than passively receiving information.

Encounters where you are clumsy and awkward, slow down and struggle, make you more graceful and fluent later on.

My note: *This is the value of drills and skill isolation where you make the skills more difficult and stretching. They are small enough and easy enough to be easily possible, but that little bit more difficult to make it worth more.*

Struggling in targeted ways, operating on the edge of your ability, makes you smarter. Effortless performance is a terrible way to learn.

Our memory is not a tape recorder, but more like scaffolding that gets another layer everything we use it, and can get more than that in cases of extreme use. There's an optimal spot between what you know and what you are trying to do and that is where rapid learning happens.

This works in an applications, education, sports, work…

### 2: The Deep Practice Cell
“I have always maintained that excepting fools, men do not differ much in intelect, only in zeal and hard work.” - Charles Darwin

The Myelin Revolution: Every human movement or ability is a precisely timed electrical circuit. Myelin is an insulator which optimizes these circuits.

It is an importance lender through which to view talent in any area and explains how experience is so valuable, because it generally leads to more meaning in the areas which perform such tasks.

You want to find activities which produce more frequent and more optimal production of myelin and use of the neural circuitry for learning. Then you may press people forward for physical conditioning with that circuit.

Targeted mistake focused practice is very effective. The struggle is what makes it valuable. Fire a circuit, attend to mistakes, and then fire again. Wrapping immense circuits with myelin required a lot of time and energy. If you don't love it, you will never find the energy to be great.

All movement and ability is a mental circuit.

Skills, once gained, feel utterly natural.

Learning is aided by myelin which enforces the mental circuitry. Myelin is the spring infrastructure that makes great action easy and consistent. It's lack has been linked with dyslexia, autism, ADHD, and many other mental disorders.

My note: this is related to the nutrition research by Dr. Weston A Price and mental disabilities such as these and morality being related to poor nutrition. Poor nutrition is largely related to the fatty parts of the brain which is myelin. Intelligence, ability, skill, and many other things are all related to white matter development. It essentially transforms what was a very small route into a super fast method of information travel. The difference between a well insulated neutron party and an uninsulated one can be 100x speed. The wait time required between one signal and the next decreases by a factor of 30 overall reducing the time for neural circuits by 3000 times.

The cells which put myelin on the neuron fibers may wrap the circuit 40 or 50 times. It's one of the most intricate cell to cell processes that exist and it is very slow.

An example of the loss of myelin is from 28 year old cellist Jacqueline du Pré who lost her ability to play almost completely and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis months later. The neural circuitry which creates greatness was still there, but the myelin around it was not.

Physical activity must support the growth and maintenance of myelin and therefore allow people to maintain mental ability at old ages. The reason many old people decline is likely the loss of myelin.

The news about myelin also explains how imagining your actions are almost equally as valuable as actually doing them because the neural circuitry is fired just the same.

The attainment of myelin is associated with Primal state: attentive, hungry, and focused, even desperate.

The most successful cultures have hunger and apply it in the right way. This is what the geography of genius was partly talking about when it said that talented areas exist because of the abilty (wealth and resources), connections (trade), and societal support for it. Interesting synergy.

The true expertise of many geniuses lies in their ability to deep-practice obsessively. The combination of myelin and time spent practicing produces a much more full picture of skill aquisition.

### 3: The Brontes, the Z-Boys, and the Renaissance
The success of the Brontes and the Z-boys was the result of time and passion spent practicing something in a concentrated and restrictive situation which may have been unspectacular at the time, but gave them lots of opportunities to catch mistakes and get better at them.

There was no special condition of the places which produced genius. Florence, the source of the renaissance, was subject to much the same circumstances as other places which a few peculiarities, but the thing that sets them apart was guilds. places where artists and craftsmen in the same profession joined up and paid dues, organized, met standards, and most importantly formed a system of learning and teaching in the master and apprentice form which produced great learning in a small area of focus. These guild turned ordinary boys into men of great artistic skill.

The more myelin you have on board, the smarter you may be. It is the difference in communication ability between humans and monkeys and the loss of ability with age and the poor impulse control of young people.

Einstein autopsy revealed increased white brain matter with normal amounts of neurons which meant nothing to the scientific community then, but is meaningful now.

### 4: The Three Rules of Deep Pratice
Great chess masters are able to memorize chess boards in a glance while were not, but when the chess boards were randomized placements, the grandmasters had no inherent advantage. The secret to the ability of the greats is chunking. It is how we can read and make meaning out of so many lines and dots and how we can do it so fast. Interpreting the meaning of a letter and then its meaning in a word and then that word’s meaning in a sentence, a paragraph and an essay. Higher level thinking requires mastery of lower level concepts.

Chunk it up. Deep practice involves starting slowly.

The act of deep practice is natural to all of us.  We have heard it many time to slow it down and take it one step at a time. Talent hotbeds show how effective that simple strategy is.

The best deep practice does three things:
1. Looks at the task as a whole
2. Breaks it down into its smallest pieces
3. Plays with time and speed with each of the pieces until they are all right and puts it all together.

Looking at the task as a whole means imitating generally and the best way to learn is to imitate. Watching other do it. Seeing it done in slow motion, quickly, all together, compeletely.

Nothing beats technique and you always start teaching with technique. Many of the absolute pros begin with technique and then start competing and training physical conditioning.

Break it into chunks: the best example of chunking was by a music school which would cut the measures of their music into little strips and then pull them out at random and play. Focus on the convection of all the little pieces. Focus on the small pits and practice it correctly. They would also break all of those strips into little pieces and alternate the rhythms, generally into a dotted pattern where there is only the connection between two notes, and then a best of rest.

Slow it down: jagged bursts of notes are broke down into giant whale sounds. The rule of thumb at this music camp is that if a passerby can recognize the song being played, they are not practicing correctly.

Good circuitry with lots of myelin requires absolute precision. Otherwise, you practice the wrong thing and develop and make more efficient a circuit which does not work optimally.

It isn't my about how fast you can do something, it is about how slow you must go to do it correctly.

In a study of experts versus novice, they sought to explain differences in ability based on how they describe their practice. In the end, 90% of ability was explained by practices. Experts had more of a strategy to what they did and Joe their practice. Their results were caused by their actions which they were able to control and improve. 

Experts develop something more than mere skill, but a detailed conceptual understanding which allowed them to control and adapt their performances.

Repeat it again and again: the quickest way to ensure that the best were no longer the best would be to stop their practice for a month. Myelin is a living thing and if it is not used or deemed necessary, it goes away. The evaporation of skills does not require injury, but lack of practice.

Practice is how you grow, improve, sharpen, and strengthen your abilities, and a lack of it for a long period of time will cause decline.

With conventional practice, more is always better. Deep practice doesn't operate the same way.  More is effective only so long as you are in the sweet spot at the edge of your capabilities. Attentively honing and improving your ability.

There is also a limit to how much deep practice can be done in a day. The limit seems to be five hours. Many of the talent hotbeds would only practice 3-5 hours a week with the youngest kids and the oldest would build up to about 15 hours per week.

Deep practice is also exhausting. Many cannot maintain it for more than an hour or two at a sitting.

The key to excellent practice and deep practice is to know when you are making errors. Sense the errors coming and then fix them. You must be able to know about them immediately. That is how you create good practice.

When asking the greatest practicers in the world, words they commonly used were: attention, context, build, while, alert, focus, mistake, repeat, tiring, edge, awake. Never heard was natural, effortless, routine, or automatic. The best practice is an uncomfortable bittersweet place to be and it creates amazing performances by constantly stretching and practicing excellence at the edge of our ability.

Baby steps are the royal road to skill. The phrase baby steps holds more within it than we can really imagine. It is the dedication and time spent working at the edge of our ability to keep learning and getting better.

## Part II: Ignition

### 5: Primal Cues
“Every gray and commanding moment in the annals of the world is a triumph of some enthusiasm.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Extreme performances requires the passion to put in dedicated work in deep practice. There must be motivational fuel. Where does that come from? What causes a giant spark of motivation and identification with success and the endless pair of excellence and improvement?

In a study of children learning music which sought to understand aptitude, the fundamental difference between achievement had nothing to do with innate ability, IQ, sense of rhythm, academic performance, or anything like that, but their commitment in the short, medium, or long term. Long term commitment combined with high levels of practice created phenomenal skills development.

Love, passion, admiration for excellence, and a desire to accelerate and achieve are what can fuel the flame for long term commitment. The beginning of excellence comes from commitment. An image in people’s mind’s about what they could be and where they are going to keep them motivated to do what they need to do to improve. Atomic Habits discussed the power of self image and identity in motivating behavioral change, and this is the same thing.

The other thing which motivates an outpouring of energy is a feeling that lacks safety. This is seen in the Rocky movies, at Gwinnett Aquatics, the physical condition of many of the talent hotbeds, and the situation where many stars in atlética and other pursuits come from. Those who feel safe in shiny faculties may become fat and lazy. There is a subconscious queue that there is no reason to get our work hard because life is good right now. If these signals spark motivation during the teenage years, it can set a pattern of for the rest of their life. Many of the greatest runners in the world were the younger children in the family. Another great many people in politics and business lost parents at a as young age. All of these steps have too potential to signal as passion and zeal for hard work and dedication to improving your personal situation. Hence how the saying, “Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times.”

Many people are ignited after seeing someone great and wanting to be like them or seeing something that they want to do and be changed mentally and committed. Olympians, watching great people, the giants of the time, spark something in us to be like them or see something valuable in a task at hand or a as pursuit or mission and get us moved and passionate about doing something about it.

### 6: The Curacao Experiment
A small island which competed with small boys and wins competitions in the international stage. It's the story of how a spark can remain ignited over time. Many places had an ignition, but not all of them kept it and continued to develop skills for years, and then maintain those performances year after year.

The baseball team for the island demonstrates the levels of selection through the years and is evidence of the success of the program and the progress made over the years. It keeps those selected in the program and motivated them from outside and below the threshold to get into the program.

The secret to these continual motivations everyday and through it all that the great person in the spotlight could be them. There are many different triggers to say that this great level could be you.

There is a consistent reliance on motivation to work harder and make baby steps towards progress. No high motivation, although that has its place, the majority of the time is spent on the small things. Affirm the struggle not the achievement, because what creates future achievement is the struggle, and we care more about the future than the present.

### 7: How to Ignite a Hotbet
Attention to details and self discipline are twice as accurate as IQ tests at predicting GPA. They also have school stops about behavioral issues where everything stops and they discuss in all classrooms a misbehavior of the student.

It is a full culture pointed towards college and motivated by the constant notes and messaging towards things.

## Part III: Master Coaching

### 8: The Talent Whisperers
The best coaches were not those who lead with ferocity and built a team out of charisma and speeches. They even seemed allergic to the pep talk or inspiring speeches. Many of the greatest teachers were quiet, or reserved. Their gaze was steady, deep, unblinking. Offering small, targeted, highly specific judgements. An extraordinary sensitivity to the person they are teaching.

From one of the best teachers on which student was better, “it is difficult to say. When I teach, I can give everyone everything. What happens after that, who can know?”

The best teachers are cultivators of myelin with extensive knowledge, discipline, and wisdom.

One of the greatest coaches of all time, John Wooden, communicated compliments 6.9% of the time, displeasure 6.6% of the time, and 75% of the time communicated pure information: what to do, how to do it, intensify the activity.

He taught in chunks using a whole part method. He would teach the whole thing and then break it down into small pieces. Work in the elemental actions. There were laws of learning which he formulated as explanation, demostraron, imitation, correction, and repetition.

You haven't taught until they have learned. The deeper you practice, the better you get.

The greatest introductory teachers are teaching a love and ignition of interest in the skill. The highest level of excellence coaching comes after you have motivated your students to work hard and try to achieve. First comes the excitement and love of learning improving and working hard. It comes from a patient teacher who works everyday to develop a love of learning. The greatest first teachers get them involved, hooked, and bedding and wanting more information. Many initial learning obrador and rewarding. 

There were standards and expectations, but growth was largely accomplished with approval and praise.

The beginning of teaching is more art than science. It starts as a messy relationship between two people and evolves as needed.

### 9: The Teaching Circuit
Great teachers focus on the student, knowing where they need to go, and see where they are struggling on that path, and then make it clear.

In the most literal sense, master coaches are the human delivery system for the signals that fuel and direct the growth of a given circuit, giving clarity and direction. It is a long intimate conversation. The essence of coaching is teaching and the essence of teaching is coaching. Developmental leadership is coaching.

It is not the exceptional brilliance of a coach and their unique knowledge of the sport or subject. Many others know the sport or subject and many even know it better. The greatest coach is the one who finds the spot of struggle for the student and makes the connection through the struggle.

<u>First Virtue of Coaching: the Matrix</u>
Most of the greatest coaches are older and developed out of a desire for people to do better than themselves. They had a career failure or something else in their life and they want to help people get past that. The age part means that they have extensive knowledge bases and connections between information to help them learn and develop.

The network of information that makes the big challenges surmountable small easy baby steps. That is the service that great teachers provide. The resources and methodology to make a great problem very simple and easy with small steps.

<u>Second Virtue of Coaching: Perceptiveness</u>
Understand what the student is going through and what they need. See what is going on in their lives. This is why so many of the greatest coaches want to know their players so they can treat them all accordingly. It makes a difference.

Great coaches are always investigating for more information to create a better response and coaching for the student.

After coaching, they are watching the student to see what they have done and developed into.

<u>Third Virtue of Coaching: The GPS Reflex</u>
Give short clear commands as instructions. They were not suggesting improvements, but you will make these improvements. Never asking them to make improvements or suggesting them, “do you think, what about, how about this?, etc” but clear, “ you will, do this, this way, like this.” Clear GPS instructional signals.

These reflexes give quick direction all the time for motivation, direction, specific changes to make, pushes in the right direction, and how tos ZAPPING at the right moment. Quick feedback.

Say when you did it, and when you didn't do it, and what to do to fix it.

Patience is very important and when a certain teaching for that student didn’t work, you tried something else until they learned. If they didn’t learn, you didn’t teach, so you must teach in a different way.

Push them to the next level, right after they reach this one. Add complexity and strengthen the skill with difficulty. Use achievements as stepping stones to progress, not stopping points.

<u>Fourth Virtue of Coaching: Theatrical Honesty</u>
Communicate the things you have to say in the way that the students can understand easily. It is an act and performance to communicate the things most clearly. It is like acting in a restaurant. Theatrical honesty works best when pointing out errors and giving information.

The greatest coaches coach in such a way that supports the development of the desired mental circuit for skills and abilities that are desired. This explains why self taught novelists, comedians, and soccer players can become world class, while violinists, skaters, and gymnasts do not commonly develop to that level. While the methods involved in different sports and abilities vary, they are all doing the same thing in the mind: developing the most important circuits for excellence.

### 10: Tom Martinez and the $60 Million Bet
One of the greatest coaches in the world. Victories in various sports with different athletes across different seasons.

He is always trying to connect with the student and figure out how to get them across the finish line. There are of course the highly talented students who pick stuff up really easy and quick, but a coach is measured by how far they can get the person who has no natural talent. When a coach can get someone without natural talent to a very competitive position, they have become a great coach.

No one can do it alone. It takes a great coach to go alongside them and make them great.

## Epilogue: The Myelin World
Everything in the world contains a grain of truth to it, and it is the synthesis of these differing and even contradictory messages that creates beautiful synergistic solutions.

There was a great conflict between methods of instructing letters and sound in developing reading and writing skills or developing an intuition and love for the skill.

The truth is that to learn to read children need the clear definitions of spelling and to learn the correct way to spell and also pay that with the ignition and passion for reading and writing. Use understanding of how the brain works, what kinds of circuits would be most useful, and then teach to develop that.

Skill is developed from proper feedback. The best teacher give the best feedback at the proper time in the proper way. Anytime feedback is accorded and you attempt to learn by osmosis, you fail or learn less. Nothing beats learning from tests.

Make the mistakes obvious so they can be fixed and spent time developing small instrumental improvements.

Psychologist Albert Ellis talks about how the things that happen in our lives do not affect us, but our opinions of them do. Therapy is thought of as helpful because it makes us feel better and deals with our feelings, but they do not attack the root problem which is that we feel that way in those circumstances. Chances of behavior and improvement of behavior and feeling comes from hanging out in more uncomfortable circumstances that do not soothe us but force us to chance, improve, and deal with the things.

Everything is a skill that you can develop. You must just be willing to sit through the discomfort of learning and being wrong so later you can be right and develop the skill.
