# Principles of Swimming

*principle:* a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation
for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.

## Comfort

No one will swim well or fast if they are uncomfortable in the water, and much
practice exists merely to work on their level of comfort more than their ability.
This is what makes swimming difficult to teach. More than someones physical ability,
it is mental.

The quickest and most sure way to get over a fear is to face it, and here are a number
of skills that can be used to get over the most common fear barriers in swimming.
These solutions work for every level of fear, from minor discomfort to deathly fear.
The only difference in application is time until effect.

### 1.1a Face in the water

This step is often not necessary, but is a baby step for those with extreme fear. Many
will be able to dunk their whole head at the beginning or want to jump right in, and you
will have little trouble with comfort until freestyle side breathing (rotary breathing).

This is the first small step which must be overcome. Occasionally, you will have a
swimmer who is still to scared to do this, and so you must make the problem smaller.
Start with just the mouth, then the nose, then the eyes, and breathing out underwater.
Anytime you come up against a wall, make the problem smaller and into something that
they can perform. No barrier is insurmountable with sufficiently small enough steps.
Some will take more steps than others, but ultimately, all can be overcome.

### 1.1b Head in the water

Again, some will jump straight in and have no opposition to that, but some do not
like the feel of water in their ears or water completely over their head. Its as
thought there is no longer air above them if their head goes under. If they have
opposition hear, again break it down into leaning back and getting their ears in and
then getting their whole head.

### 1.2 Floating Progression

**Front Float**

There are some fears to be encountered and overcome in floating. Most will be fine
floating on their stomache, but if they aren't, you must support them and simulate
floating first and build a security in that position for the initial exposure and then
move on to floating on their own. For those who legitimately cannot float, you may hold
their hands and drag them through the water quickly and give them the feeling for
floating flat even if they cannot do it on their own.

**Back Float**

The more universal fear and discomfort is floating on your back. You will usually
encounter this fear when trying to teach kicking on your back and you want your swimmer
to lay flat in the water. The natural inclination for every one is to be face down, or
upright in the water, but laying on your back is more vulnerable especially when
uncomfortable mostly because of the discomfort when water goes up your nose or comes
onto your face from the side. It can be very unexpected and scary, and floating
on your back is a calm way to get used to the position with your head very close to
the water. Pay attention to how much they want to lift their head out of the water
and you will see an indicator of how scared they are of the water or uncomfortable
on their back. It is a natural inclination that many have little control over no matter
their desire.

Typically, their fear of floating on their back makes them push their hips down as if
they will sit in the water. It doesn't work and makes it worse, but they don't know that.
For children, I can support them in their lower back, but with adults, you have to hold
in the upper back. Another less supportive way to reduce fear on their back is to
put your hand gently under their head and give them just enough to be confident there
and lift their stomache to the surface.

This is an enabler and a direct prerequesite for kicking on their back with a board or
in streamline. Weaknesses in either of these areas can be solved with sufficient
practice between floating on their back and strengthening kick on their stomache.

### 1.3 Rhythmic Breathing Progression

Rhythmic breathing is the technique used in all of swimming. It is simply breathing out
as completely as possible under the water and breathing in above the water. This enables
quick breaths and shorter deviations from best form in freestyle and butterfly later in
their development.

Everyone is afraid of drowning and proper breathing form in the water can help mediate
these concerns. Early introduction to the concept gives time and practice mastering the
skill before it is required later. Weak breathing skills will only be realized later
when you start to teach freestyle side breathing or if they start to sink while they
take breaths kicking.
