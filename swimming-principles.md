# Principles of Swimming

*principle:* a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.



## 1 Comfort

No one will swim well or fast if they are uncomfortable in the water, and a lot of practice exists merely to work on their level of comfort more than their ability. This is what makes swimming difficult to teach. More than someones physical ability, it is mental.

The quickest and most sure way to get over a fear is to face it, and here are a number of skills that can be used to get over the most common fear barriers in swimming. These solutions work for every level of fear, from minor discomfort to deathly fear. The only difference in application is time until effect.

### Face in the water

This step is often not necessary, but is a baby step for those with extreme fear. Many will be able to dunk their whole head at the beginning or want to jump right in, and you will have little trouble with comfort until freestyle side breathing (rotary breathing).

This is the first small step which must be overcome. Occasionally, you will have a
swimmer who is still to scared to do this, and so you must make the problem smaller.
Start with just the mouth, then the nose, then the eyes, and breathing out underwater.
Anytime you come up against a wall, make the problem smaller and into something that
they can perform. No barrier is insurmountable with sufficiently small enough steps.
Some will take more steps than others, but ultimately, all can be overcome.

### Head in the water

Again, some will jump straight in and have no opposition to that, but some do not
like the feel of water in their ears or water completely over their head. Its as
thought there is no longer air above them if their head goes under. If they have
opposition hear, again break it down into leaning back and getting their ears in and
then getting their whole head.

### Floating Progression

**Front Float**

There are some fears to be encountered and overcome in floating. Most will be fine
floating on their stomache, but if they aren't, you must support them and simulate
floating first and build a security in that position for the initial exposure and then
move on to floating on their own. For those who legitimately cannot float, you may hold
their hands and drag them through the water quickly and give them the feeling for
floating flat even if they cannot do it on their own.

**Back Float**

The more universal fear and discomfort is floating on your back. You will usually
encounter this fear when trying to teach kicking on your back and you want your swimmer
to lay flat in the water. The natural inclination for every one is to be face down, or
upright in the water, but laying on your back is more vulnerable especially when
uncomfortable mostly because of the discomfort when water goes up your nose or comes
onto your face from the side. It can be very unexpected and scary, and floating
on your back is a calm way to get used to the position with your head very close to
the water. Pay attention to how much they want to lift their head out of the water
and you will see an indicator of how scared they are of the water or uncomfortable
on their back. It is a natural inclination that many have little control over no matter
their desire.

Typically, their fear of floating on their back makes them push their hips down as if
they will sit in the water. It doesn't work and makes it worse, but they don't know that.
For children, I can support them in their lower back, but with adults, you have to hold
in the upper back. Another less supportive way to reduce fear on their back is to
put your hand gently under their head and give them just enough to be confident there
and lift their stomache to the surface.

This is an enabler and a direct prerequesite for kicking on their back with a board or
in streamline. Weaknesses in either of these areas can be solved with sufficient
practice between floating on their back and strengthening kick on their stomache.

### Rhythmic Breathing Progression

Rhythmic breathing is the technique used in all of swimming. It is simply breathing out
as completely as possible under the water and breathing in above the water. This enables
quick breaths and shorter deviations from best form in freestyle and butterfly later in
their development.

Everyone is afraid of drowning and proper breathing form in the water can help mediate
these concerns. Early introduction to the concept gives time and practice mastering the
skill before it is required later. Weak breathing skills will only be realized later
when you start to teach freestyle side breathing or if they start to sink while they
take breaths kicking.

It starts with blowing bubbles under the water from the nose and mouth. Rhythmic
breathing is really just that, but the power comes from the completeness of breathing
out. The best rhythmic breathing is completely out under the water and only breathing in
above the water. This extent of expertise is what is so valuable and should be taught well.
It will serve as a wonderful enabler in future swimming.

Bobs are an assessment of how well someone is able to comfortably rhythmicly breathe.
They are jumps up of the bottom up to the surface, and then going back down and breathing
out completely. Doing 10 bobs in a row means that a swimmer is able to comfortably get air
meaning they could sustainably swim with their head under the water. the idea is that the
swimmer is eventually able to hang out under the water, and just come up for air like
dolphins do rather than spend most of their time at the surface and diving under for shorter
periods of time. Success in this area is when a swimmer is able to be submerged for longer
than they are at the surface.

### Jumps in

Jumping in the pool is a catch all skill that is fun, and overcomes a lot of the fears,
although they are still their lying in wait, just overpowered by the fun of the moment,
but it functions as an excellent way to build comfort by pushing past fears.


## Core Strength

Core strength is a higher level requirement for excellent line in all of the strokes,
stabilizing the body through the kick, and converting the kick into power forward.

The best way to train it at first is just swimming and doing the positions, but it can
be enhanced with dryland planks and core exercises.


## Line

Similar to the foundational importance of comfort, there is no great swimmer with poor
line, and often the greatest swimmers in the world exemplify a line greater than the
other athletes around them. Good line makes swimming more efficient by reducing drag.
Like a torpedo or an arrow through the air, the basic position of best line for humans
is the streamline position. We only deviate from this position for swimming because of
the great power offered by the arms in swimming. If we could kick as well as fish, we
would never leave streamline, and top athletes in the world are now exploring this
alternative as more and more of the champions in international competition take advantage
of underwater portions of races, proving this theory, and also that humans must adapt and
grow to this level of excellence.

### Floating

Floating is a great first exposure to line and gives swimmers the feel for a good line
early on and it should be continually revisited in order to feel that.

### Streamline

This is the fundamental and best position of line in swimming, and it is prone to be
sloppy at all levels and must be continually reinforced until strongly in place. No
swimmer is above regression and falling back into imperfect form, especially at the
rudimentary levels.

### Comfort, Head Position, and Line

Poor comfort will hinder head position, which hinders body position/body line. Improving
line is a very easy way to make swimmers faster. It is easier to reduce drag than to
increase strenth and propulsion. Drag can be reduced through line and technique, and power
can be improved through technique and conditioning or strength training.

Getting swimmers comfortable in the water makes getting a good head positiong easier,
which in turn makes a good line easier. The body's default position is the standing with
arms at the side, and anytime you move your head, you shift your weight back and forth.
A good swimmer is balanced in their body position and lay as flat a possible in the water.
This is only possible through a good head position, strong core, and good kick.

### Notes

Swimming relies on line in the same way that planes and rockets do in the sky. It relies
on fluid mechanics and cannot take advantage of having a solid surface to propel from.
We have determined that the most efficient way to have planes, rockets, and submarines is
in a straight line, and the same is true of swimmers. It is because we have no access to
the ground as in running, and drag is a much bigger deal when all you have to push you
forward is also pushing you back.

The absolute power that line has is evident between the strokes. Breaststroke has the worse
line and it is the slowest stroke by far. Freestyle has the best line and it is the fastest
and easiest stroke. The central idea of line is that you want your body to be as small
as possible in the direction that you are going.


## Technique

Technique, more than other strokes, is foundational to excellent swimming. Most of the
benefit to speed in swimming comes from good technique over physical conditioning.
Nothing can take the precedence of good technique in swim practice and that should be
the continual focus even through conditioning sections. Technique will make or break
an athlete.

The best swimming coaches will never simply supervise a practice. They will watch and
correct what they see.
